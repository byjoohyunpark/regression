## regression-curve
This experiment uses the feature extraction method over the MobileNet model with [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) to create a regression and output continous values. Ouput is mapped to r value of rgb color ranging from pink to purple. The visual generation process takes 60 seconds and ends after that. You can draw generative visual.
